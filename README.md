# Experience
 University of California, Los Angeles Los Angeles, CA
Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Daniel Low, Prof. Anand Santhanam Jul. 2018 { Present
 Head and Neck CT Image Segmentation

 Wuhan University Wuhan, China
Research and Teaching Assistant, School of Electronic Information Sep. 2015 { Present
 Retinal Image Registration:
Research Assistant, Multi Spectral Vision Processing Lab, Advisor: Prof. Jiayi Ma Dec. 2017 { Jun. 2018
Proposed a Gaussian field estimator with manifold regularization for retinal image registration.
Achieved more than 96% precision and recall rates on multimodal retinal image pairs with partial overlaps.
Adopted a sparse approximation to estimate spatial consensus which reduces the time complexity by one order
 Robust Feature Matching:
Research Assistant, Multi Spectral Vision Processing Lab, Advisor: Prof. Jiayi Ma Feb. 2017 { Dec. 2017
Developed a robust feature matching algorithm which can handle image pairs with both rigid and non-rigid motions.
Introduced a progressive framework to reject large number of mismatches in initial matches (even up to 80%).
 Portable Devices for Magnetic Stripe Authentication:
Team Leader, National Undergraduate Scientific Research Project. Aug. 2016 { Sep. 2017
Developed portable devices that has strong reliability in identifying the authenticity of banknotes.
Optimized banknote magnetic stripe signal detection algorithm by searching peaks in scale-space.
Utilized the space between peaks as a feature and improved the accuracy of neural network and SVM by 5%.
